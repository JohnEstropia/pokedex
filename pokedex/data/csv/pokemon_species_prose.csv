When switching forms, the old signature move (if any) is removed and the new one must be learned, overwriting another move if need be, or the switch will be cancelled; however, it can be forgotten while in the new form.  There are appliances for switching forms in a secret room in the Team Galactic Eterna Building or the Silph Co. Office Building; the room in the Galactic Building requires a []{item:secret-key}, but the room in Silph Co. is freely accessible when walking with Rotom.

It is limited to Land Forme at night, when [frozen]{mechanic:frozen}, in the storage system boxes, in the Wi-Fi Club, and in the Union Room; under these conditions, Sky Shaymin reverts to Land Forme, and the Gracidea has no effect.
